The following Python program can be used to access the academic histories of this clubâ€™s
members in the scholarship database found in the scholarship_schema SQL file. To run the
program, open the scholarship_schema.sql file. Run the script to load the database. Then, open
the scholarship_objects.sql file and run all to load all database objects associated with
scholarship_schema. Open and run the provided Python program. You will be prompted to enter
your MySQL username and password. After doing so, you will arrive at the main menu, where
you can select one of 16 different operations. Selecting one of the first 15 options will execute a
function that interfaces with the database. After the function has completed, you will arrive back
at the main menu. You may choose to repeat the same operation, select a new option, or close the
program. Option 16 will terminate the connection to the database and close the program.
